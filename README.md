# Assessment

This application allows a user to register their name and address details, and stores them in the database for a later retrieval.
I've used springboot, hibernate, JPA, and thymeleaf for building this project. 


# Couldn't get the validation done on time and the date has an issue with thymeleaf template type conversion

Here are the links
